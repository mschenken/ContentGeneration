Hello there PCG grader! 

Let me take you back on a journey to the elementary school classroom
where paper airplanes were a hot commodity. Re-Experience what it felt like
to be under seige from such weapons!!!

Use the follwing settings for a great experience:
    Initial Number of creatures: 20
    World Box Size: 10
    Max velocity: 2
    Min velocity: 1
    Flock centering strength: 1
    Velocity matching strength: 1
    Collision avoidance strength: 0
    wandering strength: 1
    Max trail length: 10

    Flap frequency: 5
    Flap amplitude: 0.5


Please disregard the flashing appearance of the planes, this began happening once I implimented the flapping wings!
